<AboutRackAwareness/>

When you enable rack awareness in the Redpanda Helm chart, Kubernetes failure zones are treated as racks. Redpanda maps each rack to a failure zone and places partition replicas across them. For more details about Kubernetes failure zones, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/multiple-zones/).

## Prerequisites

Make sure that each of your Node resources is annotated with a key/value pair that corresponds to a failure zone. The Helm chart assigns each Redpanda broker to a particular rack, according to the failure zone of the Kubernetes node on which the broker is running.

<TabItem value="cloud" label="Managed" default>

Managed Kubernetes platforms in the cloud usually annotate Node resources with the availability zone in which the node instance is placed. For example `topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east-1a`.

To check the value of the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` key, run the following::

```bash
kubectl get node \
-o=custom-columns=NODE:.metadata.name,ZONE:.metadata.annotations."topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone"
```

<details>

```
NODE                 ZONE
example-worker       us-east-1a
example-worker2      us-east-1b
example-worker3      us-east-1c
```

If you don't see any values in the Zone column, see the **Self-Managed** tab.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="self" label="Self-Managed" default>

Make sure to annotate your Node resources with key/value pairs that correspond to your fault-tolerance requirements. For example:

```bash
kubectl annotate node example-worker topology.kubernetes.io/zone=rack1
kubectl annotate node example-worker2 topology.kubernetes.io/zone=rack2
kubectl annotate node example-worker3 topology.kubernetes.io/zone=rack3
```

## Enable rack awareness

To enable rack awareness in your Redpanda cluster, you need to override the default configuration in the Helm chart.

1. Create a file called `rack-awareness.yaml` in which to add the rack awareness configuration overrides.

    - If your Node resources are annotated with the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` key, add the following:

        ```yaml
        rackAwareness:
            enabled: true
        serviceAccount:
            create: true
        rbac:
            enabled: true
        ```

        By default, the Helm chart sets the rack to the value in the [well-known](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#topologykubernetesiozone) `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` key.

    - If your Node resources are annotated with a different key, set the `rackAwareness.nodeAnnotation` to match your annotation key.

        ```yaml
        rackAwareness:
            enabled: true
            nodeAnnotation: 'example'
        serviceAccount:
            create: true
        rbac:
            enabled: true
        ```

    The `serviceAccount` and `rbac` configurations are required. These configurations allow the initialization container to securely read the node annotations using the Kubernetes API.

1. Create a new Redpanda cluster with your configuration overrides or apply the configuration overrides to an existing Redpanda cluster:

    ```bash
    helm repo add redpanda https://charts.redpanda.com/
    helm repo update
    helm upgrade --install redpanda redpanda/redpanda \
        --namespace redpanda --create-namespace \
        --values rack-awareness.yaml
    ```

## Verify that rack awareness is enabled

After deploying Redpanda, make sure that rack awareness is enabled and configured on your Redpanda brokers.

1. Make sure that your Node resources include the correct annotations. For example, to check the value of the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` key, run the following:

    ```bash
    kubectl get node \
    -o=custom-columns=NODE:.metadata.name,ZONE:.metadata.annotations."topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone"
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>
    Example output
    </summary>

    ```
    NODE                 ZONE
    example-worker       us-east-1a
    example-worker2      us-east-1b
    example-worker3      us-east-1c
    ```

    </details>

1. Make sure that rack awareness has been enabled and configured on your Redpanda brokers:

    ```bash
    kubectl -ti -n redpanda exec redpanda-0 -c redpanda -- \
        grep 'rack' etc/redpanda/redpanda.yaml
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>
    Example output
    </summary>

    ```
    rack: us-east-1a
    enable_rack_awareness: true
    ```

    </details>

## Next steps

Use rack awareness with [Continuous Data Balancing](../../cluster-administration/continuous-data-balancing/) to continually maintain the configured replication level, even after a rack failure. For a given partition, Redpanda tries to move excess replicas from racks that have more than one replica to racks that have no replicas.

See the Helm chart's [values.yaml](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/redpanda/values.yaml) file for more details about the `rackAwareness`, `serviceAccount`, and `rbac` configuration options.
